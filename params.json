{"name":"Surf","tagline":"IoT/M2M for Amazon AWS","body":"##Description\r\n\r\n_Surf_ is an open source framework for simplifying system development on AWS. _Surf_ is used for collecting data across multiple technologies (messaging, logging, applications, etc.) to _Amazon Kinesis_. It also enables rapid development of Kinesis applications that are based on collected streaming data.\r\n\r\n![Surf Image](images/surf_image.PNG)\r\n\r\n_Surf_ can be deployed as a server connecting to several devices at once. Or it can be used as a library, providing an abstracted view of _Kinesis_ API. _Surf_ has a small run-time footprint and is easily extensible. We intend on keeping it up-to-date with emerging user requirements and active projects.\r\n\r\n##Why Open Source IoT/M2M with AWS?\r\n\r\nInnovation in IoT/M2M space comes from two areas – _devices _and _applications_. The connectivity fabric, operations, scaling, application integration and other platform capabilities are critical for a functioning system, but not differentiating.\r\n\r\nToday such platform capabilities are commonly provided either by Telecoms or by purpose-built products. In either case, the platforms severely limit developer’s abilities to experiment, leverage open-source community, and scale-as-you-go.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the combination of open-source frameworks and operational simplicity of AWS provides a powerful alternative to proprietary IoT/M2M platforms.\r\n\r\n![AWS Image](images/aws_image.PNG)\r\n\r\n_Surf_ is our initial step towards open source IoT/M2M frameworks.\r\n\r\n##Capabilities\r\n\r\nData sources - File-tailer, HTTP, SDK\r\nEdge processing - filtering\r\n\r\n##Futures\r\n\r\nOur objective is to extend _Surf_ as practical requirements emerge.
